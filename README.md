#Simple Search

This is a very basic Ruby on Rails app that uses a very simple search.

I'd been using Sunspot, a SOLR powered search gem, for my local database collections
and realized that moving forward with some of my projects I need to have a better understanding/
grasp over my searching mechanism.

This is very basic:

- I generated a new rails application

- I created a simple scaffold

- I added twitter-bootstrap-rails gem, therubyracer gem, and less-rails gem

- I followed the bulk of the instructions suggested on this page: [http://www.jorgecoca.com/buils-search-form-ruby-rails/](http://www.jorgecoca.com/buils-search-form-ruby-rails/_)

From here I plan to look more closely at Railscast 343 and update this functionality to be PostGRES grounded search.  

We'll see how that goes.
